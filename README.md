# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project
## Project Description
This project contains SQL queries for exploring COVID-19 data across different countries and continents. The analysis examines relationships between cases, deaths, population, and vaccination rates.

## Skills Demonstrated

SQL Joins
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Temporary Tables
Window Functions
Aggregate Functions
Views Creation
Data Type Conversion

## Data Sources
The project uses two main tables:

CovidDeaths - Contains data about COVID cases and deaths
CovidVaccinations - Contains vaccination data

## Query Highlights

COVID death percentages by country
Infection rates as a percentage of population
Countries with highest infection rates
Countries and continents with highest death counts
Global COVID statistics
Vaccination progress tracking using rolling calculations
Population vaccination percentage using CTEs and temp tables

## Visualizations
The code includes a view (PercentPopulationVaccinated) created specifically for later data visualization purposes.

## Usage
Execute the queries in sequence in SQL Server Management Studio or your preferred SQL client against a database with the COVID data tables already imported.
